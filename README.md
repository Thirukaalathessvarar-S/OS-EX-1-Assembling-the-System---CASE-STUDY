# OS-EX-1-Assembling-the-System---CASE-STUDY

## AIM:
To build the complete assembly of the Computer System

## STEPS:
### STEP 1 : OPEN THE CASE
The First Step In Assembling A Computer Is To Open The Computer Case. To Open The Case, First Remove The Screws Of The Left Side Cover And Slide The Side Cover
